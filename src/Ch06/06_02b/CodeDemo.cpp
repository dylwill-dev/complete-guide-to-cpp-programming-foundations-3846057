/*Taking arugments as pointers
    - Takes a memory address as aruments
    - Must use the "addresss of (&)" to pass arguments into this function
    - Inside the function we need to dereference using * to access tha actual values to work with
    - This function modifies the original variables

/*Takes arguments by reference
    - A more modern and cleaner approach instead of using pointers
    - No need to dereference within the body of the function
    - Modifies the original variables
    - Commonly used when you want to modify the inputs

Use Cases
    - You want to avoid copying large data
